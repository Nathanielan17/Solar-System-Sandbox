# Solar-System-Sandbox

## Purpose 
This Unity project serves to help others understand the dynamics in space by creating a 3D interactable solar system sandbox. Users can freely move around in all 3 dimensions and see the planets rotate around the sun using approximately scaled gravitational forces. Users have the capabilites to add their own interstellar object into the sandbox with the dynamic ability to decide the mass, size and color. Once the user inserts their object into the sandbox, they can see how the gravitational forces alter/change in real time as a consequence. 

The project was designed using C# and Unity asset creation tools.
